# üåü Smart Internship Matching Assistant  
*A Building AI course project*

## Summary  
This project is an AI-powered assistant that helps students find internships based on their skills, goals, and preferences. It leverages NLP and machine learning to create better matches between students and companies.  
**Building AI course project**

## Motivation  
Many students struggle to find internships that align with their technical skills or learning objectives. As someone who experienced this firsthand, I wanted to build a solution that makes internship searching more personalized and efficient.

## Project Idea  
The system matches students to internships using:
- **Technical profiles** (from GitHub, coursework, CVs)
- **Learning goals** (e.g., ‚Äúlearn about cloud computing‚Äù)
- **Company culture preferences**
- **Location and availability constraints**

It‚Äôs a two-way recommender system for both students and companies.

## How I Could Build It  
- Use **NLP** (e.g. BERT, GPT) to parse resumes and job posts  
- Build a **hybrid recommender model** using scikit-learn or TensorFlow  
- Create a small dataset of mock student and internship profiles  
- Optionally integrate a **chatbot interface** for interaction (e.g. with Rasa)

## What I Learned in the Course That Helped  
- Understanding how AI models learn from data  
- The importance of **data quality and bias prevention**  
- How **classification and prediction models** work  
- Practical use of **interpretable and ethical AI** in real-world systems
